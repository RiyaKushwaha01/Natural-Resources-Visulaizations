# Natural-Resources-Visulaizations
The U.S. government collects revenue from natural resource extraction, primarily from oil, gas, and mining operations. 
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of revenue generated from the extraction of natural resources in the United States, specifically from federal lands, federal waters, and Native American lands. 
The data spans from 2003 - 2023 and is organized by year, including details on land classification, lease types, revenue types, and commodities/products involved. 
The dataset, managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, excludes revenue from privately-owned or state lands. 
Native American revenue data is reported only at the national level to protect private and sensitive information.
